# nerdvision-commandbox

**This is currently work in progress.**

If you have commandbox installed and your github account is configured for using SSH you can execute

`box install git+ssh://git@github.com:intergral/nerdvision-commandbox.git
`
to get the module. 

Looking at the FusionReactor commandbox module I think we need a commands/register.cfc file to set the api.key for nerd.vision - not sure.
